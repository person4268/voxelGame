This is going to require refactoring a lot of code. Items don't really exist in
any sense in the block placing code. It's hard to figure out where to put
things. 

We are going to need some code to handle interaction with items and the
concept of tools most also be prepared for. 

Our creative mode is more or less going to be a hardcoded tool that can do
anything instantly, and their inventory always contains anything.
