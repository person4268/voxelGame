licensing is really confusing, especially with the textures
I'll probably add headers to all of my code and Unlicense it and design my own terrible textures since I can't find any that are under a good license besides the one I'm currently using and it isn't very good imo.

But for now, this is technically the license, so just credit me on my code.
